with a Tkinter based GUI for easier access to the classifier.

- NOTE :: This project is still in somewhat unusable state since the accuracy is
          under 90 percent, we'll improve the accuracy of the classifier later on.

- NOTE II :: Currently I am concentrating on speeding up the training and validation
             of dense training datasets, please refer to the `dense` branch in my fork 
             of libsvm for details.
